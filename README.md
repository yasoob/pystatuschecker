pystatuschecker
===============

This is a simple website status checker i made using python. Simply run this script and input the url which you want to check. It uses http://www.isup.me for this purpose. What this script does is that it simply opens isup.me and inputs the url then it scans the result page for specific string and then it gives you the result based on that string.......:) Feel free to change it or redistribute it.
